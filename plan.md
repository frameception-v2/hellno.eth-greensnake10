# Maschine-Snake Development Plan

## Phase 1: Core Game Implementation
**Objective**: Establish functional game loop and basic rendering

### Components
- `GameCanvas.tsx` component structure
- Snake movement logic with grid wrapping
- Food generation system
- Collision detection (self/walls)
- Basic score tracking system

### Technical Requirements
- React useState/useRef for game state
- Canvas rendering context
- requestAnimationFrame for animation
- Modular grid calculation (GRID_SIZE constant)

### Challenges
- Coordinating game loop timing with React state updates
- Preventing state staleness in closure-based effects
- Accurate grid-to-canvas coordinate translation
- Handling canvas resize events

### Mobile Considerations
- Viewport meta tag for mobile scaling
- Canvas aspect ratio maintenance (1:1)
- CSS touch-action: none prevention
- Initial mobile-first responsive layout

---

## Phase 2: Input Handling System
**Objective**: Implement cross-platform control scheme

### Components
- Keyboard event listeners (Arrow keys)
- Touch gesture detection (swipe)
- Input direction validation
- Visual touch feedback overlay

### Technical Requirements
- Touch start/end coordinate tracking
- Swipe direction calculation (delta X/Y)
- Directional state management
- Prevent default touch behaviors

### Challenges
- Distinguishing scrolls vs intentional swipes
- Handling simultaneous touch/keyboard inputs
- Preventing 180° direction reversals
- Mobile browser compatibility issues

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch event normalization
- Minimum swipe distance threshold
- Visual feedback for swipe recognition
- Viewport zoom prevention

---

## Phase 3: State Persistence & Social Features
**Objective**: Implement client-side storage and social sharing

### Components
- Local high score tracking
- Game state serialization
- Frame SDK integration
- Share-ready victory screens

### Technical Requirements
- localStorage API for persistence
- Frame SDK share capabilities
- Wagmi for wallet context
- Game state reset logic

### Challenges
- Serializing complex game state
- Wallet connection state management
- Mobile browser storage limits
- Share preview image generation

### Mobile Considerations
- Mobile-optimized share dialog
- Storage quota management
- Wallet connection mobile UX
- Touch-friendly share buttons

---

## Phase 4: Performance Optimization
**Objective**: Ensure smooth mobile performance

### Components
- Double buffered canvas rendering
- Animation frame debouncing
- State update memoization
- Hardware acceleration

### Technical Requirements
- Off-screen canvas buffer
- React memo() for components
- CSS will-change properties
- Performance profiling tools

### Challenges
- Jank-free animation on low-end devices
- Memory management for canvas
- Battery efficiency concerns
- Thermal throttling mitigation

### Mobile Considerations
- Touch event throttling
- Mobile GPU limitations
- Power-efficient animations
- Low-memory fallbacks

---

## Phase 5: Polishing & Testing
**Objective**: Refine UX and ensure cross-platform compatibility

### Components
- Retro visual styling
- Sound effects system
- Victory/defeat animations
- Cross-browser testing

### Technical Requirements
- Web Audio API for sound
- CSS retro font stack
- Pixel-perfect canvas rendering
- Device testing matrix

### Challenges
- Mobile audio autoplay restrictions
- Consistent color rendering
- Touch latency compensation
- Browser prefix handling

### Mobile Considerations
- Mobile-first visual hierarchy
- Touch target sizing (Fitts' Law)
- Vibration API integration
- Network condition testing

---

## Dependency Graph
1. Phase 1 → All subsequent phases
2. Phase 2 → Phase 5 (touch refinement)
3. Phase 3 → Phase 4 (storage performance)
4. Phase 4 → Phase 5 (smooth animations)

## Constraints Adherence
- **No Database**: localStorage for client-side persistence
- **No Contracts**: Wallet connection only via Frame SDK
- **Client-Side Only**: Zero external API dependencies
- **Mobile First**: All features designed with touch-first UX
